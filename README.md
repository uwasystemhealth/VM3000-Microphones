# VM3000-Microphones

This project was completed by Ricky Leman under the supervision of Dr Ben Travaglione and Professor Melinda Hodkiewicz as part of the UWA Master of Professional Engineering research units GENG5511 & GENG5512.

This project involves the design, build and testing of a microphone array prototype which implements a pair of Vesper VM3000 MEMS microphones.

This repository and the time_domain_beamforming repository (https://github.com/uwasystemhealth/time_domain_beamforming) contains all relevant files for the VM3000 PDM microphone array beamforming project.
